    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The goal of this page is to let you download one of my project, GooShaDow. This project will let you download other of my projects alongside their source code.<br/>
    The executable of GooShaDow and my others projects are not signed because I haven't brought a trusted certificate so they can trigger your antivirus software, 
    but I promise you it's not a malware and you have my name and address on my resume to prove myself to you.<br/>
    If you still doubt, you can test my program in a virtual machine and see that it is not dangerous and download the source code.<br/>
    Those softwares and sources codes are given ASIF, so I have no responsibility about any problems or problematic usages done with my work.<br/>
    No really, be careful, some of my softwares can be used to make dangerous or illegal stuffs.<br/>
    <br/>
    My executables were compiled with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/">auto-py-to-exe</a>.<br/>
    The icon was made with <a href="https://designer.microsoft.com/image-creator">designer.microsoft.com</a>.</p>
